> Upgrade's plugin support in base applications to allow plugins to be called any time after init.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install base-plugins --save
```

**What does this do?**

This plugin augments the generic plugin functionality that ships with [base](https://github.com/node-base/base).

* Without this plugin, any plugins that registered with the `use` method and are only called once upon init.
* With this plugin, other plugins that return a function will be pushed onto a `plugins` array, and can be called again later with the `run` method.

## Usage

```js
var plugins = require('base-plugins');
var Base = require('base');
var base = new Base();

// register the `plugins` plugin
base.use(plugins());
```

## Examples

### .use example

Once the `use` method is called:

1. a `fns` array is added to the instance for storing plugin functions
2. a `run` method is added to the instance for running stored plugins
3. the `use` method is modified so that anytime a function is returned by a plugin it will automatically be pushed onto the `fns` array. Besides that, you shouldn't see any behavioral changes in how the `use` method works.

## .run example

The `run` method iterates over the `fns` array and calls each stored plugin function on the given object.

```js
var collection = {};
base.use(function(app) {
  app.x = 'y';
  return function(obj) {
    obj.a = 'b';
  };
});
base.run(collection);

console.log(base.x);
//=> 'y'
console.log(collection.a);
//=> 'b'
```

## API

### [.use](index.js#L47)

Define a plugin function to be called immediately upon init. The only parameter exposed to the plugin is the application instance.

Also, if a plugin returns a function, the function will be pushed
onto the `fns` array, allowing the plugin to be called at a
later point, elsewhere in the application.

**Params**

* `fn` **{Function}**: plugin function to call
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the item instance for chaining.

**Example**

```js
// define a plugin
function foo(app) {
  // do stuff
}

// register plugins
var app = new Base()
  .use(foo)
  .use(bar)
  .use(baz)
```

### [.run](index.js#L62)

Run all plugins

**Params**

* `value` **{Object}**: Object to be modified by plugins.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the item instance for chaining.

**Example**

```js
var config = {};
app.run(config);
```
